    height: 400,
    layout: {
        backgroundColor: '#ffffff',
        textColor: '#333',
    },
    grid: {
        vertLines: { color: '#f0f0f0' },
        horzLines: { color: '#f0f0f0' },
    },
});

const candlestickSeries = chart.addCandlestickSeries({
    upColor: '#26a69a',
    downColor: '#ef5350',
    borderVisible: false,
    wickUpColor: '#26a69a',
    wickDownColor: '#ef5350',
});

// Load data from FastAPI endpoint
fetch('/api/stocks/000001/ohlc')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => candlestickSeries.setData(data));
```
